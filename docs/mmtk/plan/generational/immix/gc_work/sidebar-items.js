The const type parameter defines whether there is copying in the GC. Note that even with TraceKind::Fast, there is no defragmentation, we are still copying from nursery to immix space. So we always need to write new object references in process_edge() (i.e. we do not need to overwrite the default implementation of process_edge() as the immix plan does)."]]});
