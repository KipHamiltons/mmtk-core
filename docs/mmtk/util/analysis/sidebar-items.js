Note that the trait itself takes generic parameters that are used as the argument types for its hooks. This allows for a general framework wherein, if a developer chooses, multiple arguments can be passed to the analysis routine by packing them in a struct (for an example see the concrete implementation of PerSizeClassObjectCounter)."]]});
